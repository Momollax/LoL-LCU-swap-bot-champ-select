# LoL-LCU-swap-bot-champ-select

This is a POC for try to crash the champ select, or freeze client or anything...
The goal is to make people leave the champ select to not loose rank point, or take a 5 minutes ban.

it don't work :'(

BUT ! the bot is fun, and kinda anoying ! 

# How it work:
You will lunch the game with an friend in your friendlist.
The bot will find this friend, and get his position in the champ select.
With this info, the bot will be able to lunch a trade with your friend, and instanaly cancel it, and right after, accept a trade request.
The fact is, if your friend have the same bot, it will make the champ selet hinda broken, and everyone will lag.

# How to run it:
requirements:   - python  (download: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
                - pip     (download: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
                
Install the library:
pip install lcu_driver

run the script: python main.py

Voila !
